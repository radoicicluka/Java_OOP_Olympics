# Java_OOP_Olympics
This project was a homework assignment. The application presents data from the Olympics via pie-charts and XY-graphs. 

The app presents data from the Olympics in four different ways. Those are number of contestants, number of disciplines, average height 
and average weight of the contestants. The first option is presented via pie-chart of number of athletes divided by country for which they compete.
Other options are divided by years and are presented on a graph where the x-axis is for years and the y-axis depends on a chosen option.

Before presenting the data, a user is asked to parse data from .txt files that can be found with the project. The user chooses to parse for a single year
or for all years.
